# MongoDB

# The purpose of this assignment is to get familiar with a NoSQL database
called MongoDB, store data in MongoDB, and query them by using MongoDBâ€™s
query language. At the end you will do the same in MySQL and you will write
down your experience from using these two different in philosophy databases. (Rutgers University - CS336)
